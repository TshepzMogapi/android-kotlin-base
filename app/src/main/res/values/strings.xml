        Android mobile development has been Kotlin-first since Google I/O in 2019
        Using Kotlin for Android development, you can benefit from:
        \n\n
        Write better Android apps faster with Kotlin. Kotlin is a modern statically typed programming language used by over 60% of professional Android developers that helps boost productivity, developer satisfaction, and code safety.
        \n\n
        Kotlin\'s modern language features allow you to focus on expressing your ideas and write less boilerplate code.
        \n\n
        With @Nullable and @NonNull included in its type system, Kotlin helps you avoid NullPointerExceptions. Android apps that use Kotlin are 20% less likely to crash.
        \n\n
        Kotlin is 100% interoperable with the Java programming language, so you can have as little or as much of Kotlin in your project as you want.
